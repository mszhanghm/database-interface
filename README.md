This is an interface for object-based databases. A database is treated as a binary tree, of which a node stored an arbitrary Record object. A Record is required to have a Key field, which is in turn an object with Compariable property defined. Here are Record and Key interfaced are defined, so that their CLASS and METHODs could be used by the Database class. An implementation of the database is shown in the repository data-implementation-Library, where Book implements Record, CatalogNumber implements Key.
